					<h2>Info</h2>
					<p>This visualization website was created as part of INST490 CAPSTONE project from students at 
					University of Maryland in conjunction with representatives from City of Hyattsville.<br>
					This website has two main parts, 'Maps Page' and 'Compare Maps' page. 'Maps' contains a compilation
					of maps of Hyattsville with different aspects that contributes to the watershed. 'Compare Maps' 
					is a page that will help you compare two maps side by side to better understand how one is related to 
					the other.<br>
					The team members of this project are:
					</p>
					<li>Aseem Dhakal</li>
					<li>Anastasia Agapova</li>
					<li>Reggie Padgett</li>
